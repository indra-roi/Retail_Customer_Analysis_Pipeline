## 📌 Project Overview
This project bridges the gap between raw data and executive decision-making. I engineered a fully automated data pipeline that cleans 4,000+ retail records using **Python**, stores them in a **Cloud-native PostgreSQL** environment, and visualizes real-time performance via **Power BI**.

This isn't just a static report—it's a scalable architecture designed for modern data-driven organizations.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture


### **1. Data Engineering (Python & ETL)**
* **Tool:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* **Action:** Performed deep data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g., age-group segmentation) to make raw data analytics-ready.
* **Connection:** Used `SQLAlchemy` to create a secure tunnel between the Python environment and the Cloud database.

### **2. Cloud Infrastructure (Neon PostgreSQL)**
* **Platform:** Neon Cloud
* **Action:** Architected a relational schema to store processed shopping trends, ensuring data durability and accessibility for remote BI tools.

### **3. Business Intelligence (Power BI & DAX)**
* **Connectivity:** DirectQuery link to Neon Cloud for real-time reporting.
* **Logic:** Built custom DAX measures to calculate critical KPIs:
    * **Total Customer Base:** 4,000
    * **Average Transaction Value:** $59.76
    * **Customer Satisfaction Score:** 3.75/5.0

## 🛠️ Challenges Overcome
* **Permission Management:** Solved Google Colab saving restrictions by architecting a drive-based workspace.
* **Cloud Security:** Successfully configured **Data Source Credentials** in the Power BI Service to enable secure cloud-to-cloud data refreshing.

## 📈 Executive Summary of Results
* **High-Value Segments:** Identified key demographics driving the $59.76 average spend.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Established a 3.75 rating baseline for customer service improvement strategies.
